To work on the tests, open a browser and visit http://{{host}}:{{port}}.

The tests are in files in the tests/app directory; you will need to fill out
the answers in the corresponding files in the app directory, your browser will 
reload when you save the files.

For some tests, the instructions will be more involved; in those cases, the
inline comments should give you the details you need.

Some tests have wrong assertions. You have to fix them accordingly.
You have to find out for yourself which tests are affected by this. The use
of a debugger is recommended.
